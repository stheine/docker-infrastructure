one solution I found that may or may not be an official solution, is to install entware, and then install git through entware.

QNAP Club has a qpkg of it available for download, or you can add their repo to your AppCenter

Once you've installed it, you can run
  opkg update
  opkg install git
  opkg install git-http # for cloning repos via http instead of ssh
